			This is my grandmother's biscuit recipe. It is my all-time favorite and has a really good flavor to it. Be sure not to roll out too thin, you want high biscuits! I usually just pat out the dough to the desired thickness, usually 1/2 inch.

			These warm and fluffy biscuits will dissolve right in your mouth.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>½ cup vegetable shortening</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>⅔ cup milk</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt into a bowl. Use a pastry cutter to chop vegetable shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk egg and milk together in a separate bowl and slowly add milk mixture to flour mixture, stirring as you pour, until dough is moistened and well-mixed. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits have risen and are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
