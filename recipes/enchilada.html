		<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Ultimate Creamy Chicken Enchiladas</h1>
		<img alt="picture of a creamy, cheesy, enchilada" src="../img/enchilada.jpeg" width="50%">
		<p>
			This is like a creamy, cheesy, full-of-flavor-in-every-bite dish. The chicken is tender and moist and the tortillas are soft. The enchilada sauce is tangy and pungent and complements the creamy, rich filling so well. This is also great for entertaining because it can be fully assembled ahead of time or even frozen and cooked later. Serve with toppings such as salsa, sour cream, avocado, cilantro, and jalapenos.

			This juicy goodness is going to be cooked over a medium sized sauce pan and will not require more than 45 min of your time to prep and cook.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>¼ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons chili powder, divided</li>
			<li>1½ teaspoons ground cumin, divided</li>
			<li>12 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>1 medium poblano pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
			<li>1 small yellow bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
			<li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)</li>
			<li>½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
			<li>4 ounces sour cream</li>
			<li>4 cups shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend, divided</li>
			<li>1 cup refried beans</li>
			<li>1 (15 ounce) can red enchilada sauce</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Place chicken on a large sheet of foil and season with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Seal the foil around the chicken and place the packet on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender and no longer pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Shred cooked chicken and set aside. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
			<li>While chicken cooks, prepare tortillas. Spread both sides of each tortilla lightly with butter. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Toast each tortilla, about 10 seconds on each side, and set aside.</li>
			<li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, poblano pepper, and bell pepper and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Add remaining salt, chili powder, and cumin and cook, stirring frequently, until veggies are very tender, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in tomatoes and cream cheese. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese has melted. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and 2 cups Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend.</li>
			<li>Spread about 1 tablespoon refried beans, if using, in the center of a tortilla. Add about 1/4 cup chicken filling and roll up to seal. Repeat with remaining beans and filling. Pour 1/4 cup sauce in the bottom of 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange enchiladas in a single layer over the sauce. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top and spread to evenly coat. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving with desired toppings.</li>
